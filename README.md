# OTP Input

An OTP input interface in React.js allows users to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) by providing a series of input fields, typically one for each digit. As the user types, the focus automatically shifts to the next field, and backspace handling moves focus to the previous field. The entered OTP is captured and processed for verification.
